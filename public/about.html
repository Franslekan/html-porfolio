<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Frans Olamilekan Anthony from Lagos State.
  Well, this is somehow weird, since i literally have to think hard before i can remember things about myself LOL.

<p>
  Anyway, i love being honest and truthful, it makes me more dignified in the presence of my friends and Family.
  But more importantly, I love Programming, the desire to learn more burns bright in me.
  I would ensure i utilize this knowledge to my fullest capability.

  Finally, thank you very much DR.Angela for giving us this opportunity to learn easily and in convienience. May Almighty God Bless us all and continue to provide for us in ease and comfortability.
  Goodbye for now, i would see y'all on the next project.
